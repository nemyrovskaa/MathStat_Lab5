# Statistical Data Analysis â€“ Laboratory Work

2022

This repository contains a laboratory work focused on statistical data analysis, including sample analysis, distribution parameter estimation, and visualization.

## Tasks Covered
- Preliminary sample analysis: Constructing statistical series, empirical distribution functions, frequency polygons, and histograms.

- Calculation of statistical characteristics: Sample mean, variance, median, mode, skewness, and kurtosis.

- Grouped data analysis: Estimating the sample median using interval statistical distributions.

- Parameter estimation: Applying the method of moments and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine distribution parameters.
